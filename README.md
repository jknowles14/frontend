# Frontend
This exercise is a frontend challenge to create a screen for an app called "Busy Bus". I researched the public transit app market and surveyed users. Then I created a visual design for the “Washington and State” bus stop screen using Figma and then developed the screen using HTML and CSS. 

<h3>Problem - </h3>
At the Washington and State Bus Stop, there are seven bus routes serving the same bus stop. Riders want to know what the next arriving bus is and how much time they have to get to the bus stop.

<h3>Strategy - </h3>
To show you all seven buses that will be stopping at that bus stop, what time they get there and where they are going.

<h3>Competitive Analysis:</h3>
<ul><li>Helped identify options for differentiation</li>
<li>Compared Google Maps to Moovit</li>
<li>Moovit’s design is simpler</li>
<li>Moovit is designed just for public transit users</li>
<li>Google Maps is for all users</li>
<li>Google Maps had a lot more information and options</ul>

<h3>Survey Findings:</h3>
<ul>
<li>About half of those surveyed indicated they used the bus the more than any other form of public transportation</li>
<li>Google maps was the most used app</li>
<li>90% of users surveyed used the map function on public transportation apps</li></ul>

<h3>Survey Comments:</h3>
<ul> What did you like about the transportation app(s) you used in the past?
  <li> “Information is reliable” </li>
  <li> “Easy and simple”</li>
  <li> “Had multiple options/routes, easy to use”</li>
</ul>
<ul> What did you dislike?
  <li> “Timing can be inaccurate”</li>
  <li> “When arrival times are incorrect, when there is a delay but the app doesn't tell me”</li>
</ul>

<h3>User Testing:</h3>
  <ul> <li>The usability tests were successful. </li>
  <li>100% of the users could easily articulate when their bus would arrive. </li>
  <li>They all understood that other bus lines would arrive before their bus and there was no reason to run for the bus. </li>
</ul>

# Coding Lessons Learned 

<p> On this project, I was still learning proper syntax and working on keeping things looking clean and therefore easier to read. With a grader's suggestions I put the font family in one location. She also taught me to link the font family to make it work. Since this is essentially a list of buses, I learned that it would be better to make it an un-ordered list instead of a div mess. Another grader pointed out that I was missing the closing end of one tag which when corrected made my bus stop name disappear. Then I remembered that title tags are just for the tab and that info doesn't appear on your screen and weren't even supposed to be there. I had them empty above so I fixed that. </p>
